# PubSub via AWS Dashboard

![AWS IoT logo](/images/aws-iot-logo.jpg)

## Outcome

In performing this activity, you'll __subscribe and publish to a topic__ on the AWS IoT Dashboard, with a __formatted JSON message__.

## Introduction

A **message broker** is a pub/sub service used to send and receive messages between devices and apps. 

Each message is **published** to a **topic**, and the message broker then delivers those messages to all of the topic's **subscribers**. An useful analogy is a Slack channel: Each Slack channel is like a topic, and members can send (publish) messages to other members of the channel (subscribers).

The messaging protocol we will be using is MQTT, specifically version 3.1.1. In more detailed activities, you will use websockets to send and receive MQTT messages, but for now you'll will use the AWS dashboard to communicate with the `makersPrep` topic we've set up.

  **Message format:** a JSON object with attributes `"name"` as your full name, `"completed_prep"` as `true`, and an optional `"message"` string containing text of your choice.

6. If your message is successfully published, **Maker Bot** on Slack will post to your team channel! ðŸ¤–ðŸŒˆ
